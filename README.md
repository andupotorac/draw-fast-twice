## draw fast

This is a fun exploration project I built during [Tldraw hack night](https://x.com/lichinlin/status/1727808948059722150?s=20) 🧑‍💻 the purpose of this hack night is to try out different ideas about LCM, a realtime stable diffusion model, on the 2D Canvas.

Draw fast twice is a concpet about making the linked list or a pipeline where we can pass the result from a frame down to the next frame (as the input)! 

Just...

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting
Since this is a proof of concept built in 1 hour, you might encounter some unexpected behavior (for example somehow the pipeline stop). The simplest way to fix that is: **Select All(with hotkey `cmd+a`) > Delete > Refresh the page**
